# Zindi GBV Twitter Classification

Gender-based violence, or GBV, is an ongoing and ever-resent scourge around the world, and is particularly prevalent in developing and least-developed countries. Gender-based violence also increased in many parts of the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.

One of the greatest challenges in combating GBV is the ‘culture of silence’, where victims of violence are scared, ashamed or intimidated to discuss their experiences with others and often do not report their experiences to authorities.

Another challenge faced by victims is achieving justice for their abusers. Some may not be aware of support systems, or not know where and how to report the perpetrators.

Victims may find and safety sharing their experiences online (as evidenced by the #MeToo movement), allowing them to get more support in an anonymous and/or safe way.

The objective of this challenge is create a machine learning algorithm that classifies tweets about GBV into one of five categories: sexual violence, emotional violence, harmful traditional practices, physical violence and economic violence.

Your solutions can be used to summarise tweets and present evidence to policymakers and law enforcement agencies. Along with the classification algorithm, statistics about when and who made the tweet can be used to find trends while preserving anonymity.
